# Socialnetwork

Twitter-like (not entirely a clone) app, design as practice for the implementation of sign-up/storage features, does not include a follow-followback feature but focuses on the publish-reaction dynamics.

## Libraries implemented:

In the project we will need:

### `styled components`

### `web font loader`
### `React Router{BrowserRouter, Route, Switch, useHistory, useParams}`
### `Firebase {auth, firestore, database}`
### `REACT-DAY-PICKER`
### `DATE-FNS`
